# Evolutionary-Computation-For-Optimize-The-Location-Of-Base-Stations
In this project, different types of Evolutionary Computation methods can be run with different parameters to optimize location of Base Stations. The aim is to adjust the location of the Base Stations to minimize the number of Customers not covered by the stations.
